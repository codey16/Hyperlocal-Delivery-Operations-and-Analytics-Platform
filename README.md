Hyperlocal Delivery Operations & Analytics Platform

A robust, fully normalized SQL Server database solution designed to manage the complexities of end-to-end hyperlocal delivery operations. This project simulates a production-level environment, focusing on data integrity, automated workflows, and business intelligence.

🚀 Key Features:

- Comprehensive Schema Design: Supports Users, Vendors, Inventory, Orders, Payments, and real-time Delivery Tracking.
- Business Intelligence: Advanced SQL queries and Views to track revenue trends, vendor performance, and top-selling products.
- Automated Workflows: Implemented SQL Triggers for automated inventory updates and SQL Server Agent Jobs for daily sales reporting.
- Optimization: Utilized Indexes to ensure high-performance query execution on realistic datasets (100+ orders).
- Security: Integrated Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to simulate secure production-level operations.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

- Database Engine: SQL Server (MSSQL)
- Tools: VS Code (SQL Server Extension) / SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Languages: T-SQL (Stored Procedures, Triggers, Views, Complex Joins)
